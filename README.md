# Vue-skills

This project is simply a place to experiment with Vue.js things.  Originally it followed a youtube tutorial, then its just been modified to test things our here and there.

## How to use it

1. Clone the repro
1. `cd` to the project folder 
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run serve`

You should see the app running locally.  You may make changes and the server will automatically restart. If you wish to deploy this, you should run `npm run build` and your optimized files will be dropped into the `dist` folder.
